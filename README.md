# Employee Management System 📊

## 📝 Description
Welcome to the **Employee Management System (EMS)**! This project is a simple yet effective task management system for organizations. It features two dashboards:

- **Admin Dashboard**: Assign tasks to employees and track their progress.
- **Employee Dashboard**: View assigned tasks and update their status.

This system ensures smooth workflow management with a clear **task tracking** mechanism using **React.js** and **Local Storage**.
